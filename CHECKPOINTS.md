# Model Checkpoints: Provenance, Hashes, Licenses

Three detectors are audited. **Only the MRM checkpoint is our own artifact and is
bundled in this package** (`checkpoints/mrm/55.pth`). BAM and CFPRF are the
**original authors' released** checkpoints; we do **not** re-host them (BAM has no
license; CFPRF's authors host their own). Download them from the sources below and
verify the SHA256 to obtain the exact weights we used.

> Integrity note: MRM is **not** the original Zhang et al. model. It is the open
> reimplementation `MultiResoModel-Simple` (Hieu-Thi Luong), which we **trained
> ourselves** on PartialSpoof (see `TRAINING.md`). The paper attributes it
> accordingly.

## Detector checkpoints

| Detector | File (our path) | Size | SHA256 | Source repo @ commit | License | In this package? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| **BAM** | `BAM/bam_checkpoint/model.ckpt` | 1.35 GB | `5c7379d23028606d3beeb8b1aa5c340395fcc403ce70a2ca559ea322ab2994d1` | `github.com/media-sec-lab/BAM` @ `55f3fb9e3b4dd6281597b86d7712fb23454179f6` | **none (all rights reserved)** | NO, download below |

> CFPRF note: only the FDN (frame-detection) checkpoint for PartialSpoof
> (`1FDN_PS.pth`) was available/used; there is no `2PRN_PS` proposal-refinement
> checkpoint in the repo for PartialSpoof.

## Download instructions

- **BAM checkpoint** (`model.ckpt`): Google Drive link in the BAM README:
  `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eL3Ca27hEruI20lkoqkQEnZlb2GzTyHT/view`.
  Place at `BAM/bam_checkpoint/model.ckpt`; verify SHA256 above.
- **CFPRF checkpoint** (`1FDN_PS.pth`): from the CFPRF repo at the commit above.
- **MRM**: bundled here. Luong also hosts *different-run* checkpoints at
  `huggingface.co/hieuthi/MultiResoModel-Simple-ckpts` (their `baseline-ps-e55`
  reports 1.48% utt-EER / 13.67% frame-EER; **ours** reports 0.94% / 13.91%, a
  separate training run, see `TRAINING.md`).

## Checkpoint hosting (Hugging Face)
The bundled `55.pth` is also hosted on the Hugging Face Hub, so it can be fetched
without downloading the full package:

> **https://huggingface.co/sukhdeveyash/partial-spoof-mrm-audit**

Verify SHA256 `5b753752f7c25370c6abf973f69f58e100dad4b5d3ea035872335358a876fdd1`
after download. Only the MRM checkpoint is hosted by us; BAM and CFPRF stay at
their authors' sources above.
